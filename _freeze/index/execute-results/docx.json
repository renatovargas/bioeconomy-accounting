In contrast to similar studies, we\n  suggest that an _a priori_ classification of economic \n  activities as bioeconomic underestimates the real \n  contribution of the bioeconomy. Instead we suggest \n  limiting to classifying products as bioeconomic or not \n  and then evaluating the bioeconomic content of \n  intermediate consumption. We provide a detailed example \n  of these ideas for Costa Rica and estimates for 13 \n  Latin Ammerican economies.\n  \nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n## Section\n\nThis is a simple placeholder for the manuscript's main document [@knuth84].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
