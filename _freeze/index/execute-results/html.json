In contrast to similar studies, we\n  propose not to classify economic activities as belonging \n  to the bioeconomy or not _a priori_.\n  \nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n## Section\n\nThis is a simple placeholder for the manuscript's main document [@knuth84].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
