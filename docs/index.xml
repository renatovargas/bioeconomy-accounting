<abstract>
<p>We propose a practical methodology to estimate Bioeconomic Satellite
Accounts following the rules outlined in the System of National Accounts
for analytical extensions. This methodology reaggregates classifications
within the Supply and Use tables of this system to assess the economic
value of inputs and outputs driven by biological resources for all
economic activities. In contrast to similar studies, we suggest that an
<italic>a priori</italic> classification of economic activities as
either “bioeconomic” or “non-bioeconomic” underestimates value added by
biological resources that fall outside the predetermined activities.
Instead, we assess the economic contribution driven by biological
resources for all activities and propose direct and indirect methods to
rank them according to their importance for bioeconomic policy. We
provide estimates for 13 Latin American economies.</p>

<sec id="introduction">
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>In 2018, the Costa Rican Government published that country’s
  National Bioeconomy Strategy, following closely the agreed definition
  crafted in the context of the German Bioeconomy Council
  (<xref alt="German Bioeconomy Council, 2018" rid="ref-german_bioeconomy_council_global_2018" ref-type="bibr">German
  Bioeconomy Council, 2018</xref>), which states that the Bioeconomy
  is:</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>“The production, use, conservation, and regeneration of
    biological resources, including the knowledge, science, technology,
    and innovation related to these resources, to provide information,
    products, processes, and services to all economic sectors, with the
    goal of advancing toward a sustainable economy
    (<xref alt="Gobierno de Costa Rica, 2020" rid="ref-gobiernodecostarica2020" ref-type="bibr">Gobierno
    de Costa Rica, 2020</xref>).”</p>
  </disp-quote>
  <p>Additionally, this strategy details what should be understood as
  “biological resources” within that framework, which includes
  <bold>i)</bold> biomass cultivated to produce food, fodder, fibers,
  and energy; <bold>ii)</bold> biomass from marine resources and that
  produced through aquaculture; <bold>iii)</bold> forest biomass,
  especially that cultivated for use in the forestry and paper
  industries, as well as that legally extracted from natural ecosystems;
  <bold>iv)</bold> residual biomass from the agricultural, fishing and
  aquaculture, forestry, and agro-industrial sectors; <bold>v)</bold>
  biomass that can be recovered from urban waste; <bold>vi)</bold>
  liquid waste from livestock and human activities; and
  <bold>vii)</bold> terrestrial and marine biodiversity, including the
  biodiversity of inland waters.</p>
  <p>Public policies informed by data have been shown to be more
  efficient in reaching their objectives and, while Costa Rica has a
  long tradition in the production of environmental accounts
  (<xref alt="BCCR, 2021" rid="ref-bccr_cuentas_2021" ref-type="bibr">BCCR,
  2021</xref>) following the System of Environmental and Economic
  Accounts–SEEA–(<xref alt="European Commission, Economic Cooperation, Development, United Nations, &amp; World Bank, 2013" rid="ref-europeancommission2013" ref-type="bibr">European
  Commission, Economic Cooperation, Development, United Nations, &amp;
  World Bank, 2013</xref>), there was a gap in the assessment of the
  direct and indirect contribution of biological resources to the
  economy that policymakers needed to close.</p>
  <p>Given the richness of information regarding biological resources
  that is collected to assess the economic performance of the country,
  we saw an opportunity to close this gap by extending the System of
  National Accounts (SNA), the framework with which Gross Domestic
  Product (GDP) is measured, among many other indicators, to highlight
  the contribution of those resources. The SNA manual
  (<xref alt="European Commission et al., 2009, p. 523" rid="ref-europeancommission2009" ref-type="bibr">European
  Commission et al., 2009, p. 523</xref>) provides clear guidelines on
  how to develop analytical extensions–specifically <italic>Key Sector
  Accounts</italic> and <italic>Satellite Accounts</italic>–and we chose
  to adhere to those guidelines to avoid deviations from SNA’s concepts
  and accounting rules and mantain comparability with traditional
  economic indicators. In particular, we focused on reaggregating
  classifications of the Supply and Use Tables that detail the
  production account of the System.</p>
  <p>This strict adherence to the principles of SNA and the
  standarization procedure developed to handle Supply and Use data in
  the case of Costa Rica, allowed us to readily extend this exercise to
  13 Latin American economies. This was possible because these economies
  have made their Supply and Use tables publicly available and this
  information has been centralized in a repository
  (<xref alt="ECLAC, 2021" rid="ref-eclac2021" ref-type="bibr">ECLAC,
  2021</xref>). Relying on the SNA principles, definitions,
  classifications, and accounting rules also gave us an opportunity to
  express results related to the Bioeconomy using concepts that are
  easily understood by policy-makers because of their widespread use in
  economic performance analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="methods">
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Supply and Use tables are multi-dimensional matrices that show in
  great detail the production and import of goods and services by
  economic activities in a country and how those are used, either in the
  production process itself as inputs, or are consumed by other agents
  in the economy or by the rest of the world. The detail of products is
  arranged according to</p>
  <p>Table 1 presents a summarized version of Costa Rica’s supply table
  for the year 2018 as a reference. The rows show an aggregated version
  of six groups of goods and services offered in the economy, with the
  original, fully disaggregated table detailing a total of 184 products
  (BCCR, 2021a). The first dimension of the columns provides an
  aggregated adaptation of the economic transactions related to supply.
  The sequence of these transactions explains a flow where production at
  basic prices (i.e., the price at the farm gate, factory, or commercial
  establishment) is combined with imports free of insurance and freight
  costs to form the supply at basic prices. However, this is not the
  price paid by economic agents. To reach the market, taxes on products
  are added to the basic price supply, minus any subsidies received,
  followed by distribution margins (transportation and commercialization
  costs). This results in the total supply at purchaser’s prices, found
  in the last column. These figures represent the total available for
  purchase by economic agents in the utilization phase.</p>
  <p>In the second dimension of the columns, the disaggregation of
  production shows economic activities grouped into three representative
  sectors: a primary agricultural and extractive sector, a manufacturing
  sector, and a sector encompassing all services. The disaggregated
  supply table for Costa Rica includes details on 144 industry groups,
  identifying the portion under foreign and domestic control, divided
  into market production, non-market production, and production for own
  final use (BCCR, 2021a). There is no one-to-one correspondence between
  rows and columns, meaning that each economic activity can produce one
  or more products from the rows, and each product can be produced by
  one or more economic activities. Typically, there is a primary product
  characteristic of each economic activity, as well as secondary
  production of any other goods in the economy.</p>
  <p>To uncover the contribution of biological inputs to the Economy, we
  propose a deviation from the existing efforts in the field; hereafter,
  “the traditional approach”. These first exercises have deemed certain
  economic activities as “bioeconomic,” based on their primary
  production, and they have added together, either all, or a fraction of
  their Value Added (VA) as a proxy for the “Bioeconomic GDP”. This has
  been a necessary compromise, because “biological” is a quality of
  products, but VA and GDP are aggregates that are estimated at the
  economic activity or total economy level, not from the product
  perspective. While these first approximations have provided valuable
  estimates of the size of the Bioeconomy, they have limitations.</p>
  <p>Within the production account of the System of National Accounts,
  often summarized into Supply and Use Tables (SUTs), economic
  activities can produce more than one product and, in turn, any product
  in the Economy can be produced by more than one activity. Activities
  will normally have a larger fraction of their output devoted to a
  group of products that share characteristics, which is deemed their
  primary production, and it will be used to determine the corresponding
  economic activity classification name. For example, all the production
  of companies that grow strawberries, cranberries, and blackberries,
  almonds, cashew nuts, and chestnuts, will be recorded under sector
  “0125 - Growing of other tree and bush fruits and nuts” of the
  International Standard Industry Classification (ISIC), Revision 4, at
  four digits. Some activities will also have a smaller fraction of
  their production that corresponds to the primary production of another
  sector. For example, it could be common in a certain region for some
  berries farms to directly sell small batches of fermented drinks that,
  which would normally be classified as primary production of another
  activity: “1102 - Manufacture of wines”, but that probably do not go
  through a formal industrial process.</p>
