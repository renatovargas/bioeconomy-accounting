\begin{abstract}
We propose a practical methodology to estimate Bioeconomic Satellite
Accounts following the rules outlined in the System of National Accounts
for analytical extensions. This methodology reaggregates classifications
within the Supply and Use tables of this system to highlight the
economic contribution of inputs and outputs driven by biological
resources for all economic activities. In contrast to similar studies,
we suggest that an \emph{a priori} classification of economic activities
as either ``bioeconomic'' or ``non-bioeconomic'' underestimates value
added by biological resources that fall outside the predetermined
activities. Instead, we assess the economic contribution driven by
biological resources for all activities and propose direct and indirect
methods to rank them according to their importance for bioeconomic
policy. We exemplify the methodology with the case of Costa Rica and
provide estimates for 13 Latin American economies.
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In 2018, the Costa Rican Government published that country's National
Bioeconomy Strategy, following closely an internationally agreed
definition crafted in the context of the German Bioeconomy Council
(German Bioeconomy Council, 2018a), which states that the Bioeconomy is:

\begin{quote}
``The production, use, conservation, and regeneration of biological
resources, including the knowledge, science, technology, and innovation
related to these resources, to provide information, products, processes,
and services to all economic sectors, with the goal of advancing toward
a sustainable economy (Gobierno de Costa Rica, 2020a).''
\end{quote}

Additionally, this strategy details what should be understood as
``biological resources'' within that framework, which includes
\textbf{i)} biomass cultivated to produce food, fodder, fibers, and
energy; \textbf{ii)} biomass from marine resources and that produced
through aquaculture; \textbf{iii)} forest biomass, especially that
cultivated for use in the forestry and paper industries, as well as that
legally extracted from natural ecosystems; \textbf{iv)} residual biomass
from the agricultural, fishing and aquaculture, forestry, and
agro-industrial sectors; \textbf{v)} biomass that can be recovered from
urban waste; \textbf{vi)} liquid waste from livestock and human
activities; and \textbf{vii)} terrestrial and marine biodiversity,
including the biodiversity of inland waters.

Public policies informed by data have been shown to be more efficient in
reaching their objectives and, while Costa Rica has a long tradition in
the production of environmental accounts (BCCR, 2021) following the
System of Environmental and Economic Accounts--SEEA--(European
Commission, Economic Cooperation, Development, United Nations, \& World
Bank, 2013), there was a gap in the assessment of the direct and
indirect contribution of biological resources to the economy that
policymakers needed to close.

Given the richness of information regarding biological resources that is
collected to assess the economic performance of the country, we saw an
opportunity to close this gap by extending the System of National
Accounts (SNA), the framework with which Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is
measured, among many other indicators, to highlight the contribution of
those resources. The SNA manual (European Commission et al., 2009a, p.
523) provides clear guidelines on how to develop analytical
extensions--specifically \emph{Key Sector Accounts} and \emph{Satellite
Accounts}--and we chose to adhere to those guidelines to avoid
deviations from SNA's concepts and accounting rules and mantain
comparability with traditional economic indicators. In particular, we
focused on reaggregating classifications of the Supply and Use Tables
that detail the production account of the System.

This strict adherence to the principles of SNA and the standarization
procedure developed to handle Supply and Use data in the case of Costa
Rica, allowed us to readily extend this exercise to 13 Latin American
economies. This was possible because these economies have made their
Supply and Use tables publicly available and this information has been
centralized in a repository (ECLAC, 2021). Relying on the SNA
principles, definitions, classifications, and accounting rules also gave
us an opportunity to express results related to the Bioeconomy using
concepts that are easily understood by policy-makers because of their
widespread use in economic performance communications and analysis.

\subsection{Data and Methods}\label{data-and-methods}

\subsubsection{Supply and Use Tables are used as data
sources}\label{supply-and-use-tables-are-used-as-data-sources}

Supply and Use tables from SNA (European Commission et al., 2009b) are
multi-dimensional matrices that show in great detail the production and
import of goods and services by economic activities in a country and how
those are used, either in the production process itself as inputs, or
are consumed by other agents in the economy or by the rest of the world.
The detail of products is arranged according to the Central Product
Classification--CPC--(United Nations, 2015) and economic activities are
arranged according to the International Standard Industrial
Classification of All Economic Activities--ISIC--(United Nations, 2008)
or local adaptations thereof. In addition to products and economic
activities, these tables have an additional dimension that shows
different types of transactions that those products drive in their
journey from producers to consumers.

In the case of the supply table, the sequence of those transactions
describes a flow where different products in the rows are produced by
economic activities in the columns at basic prices (i.e., the price at
the farm gate, factory, or commercial establishment). This output is
then combined with imports free of insurance and freight costs to form
the supply at basic prices. However, this is not the price paid by
economic agents. To reach the market, taxes on products are added to the
basic price supply, minus any subsidies received, followed by
distribution margins (transportation and trade costs). This results in
the total supply at purchaser's prices, found in the last column of the
table, which represents what is available for purchase by the same
economic agents in the use table. For these additional columns of
transactions, the product detail (rows) is mantained, but not the
economic activity detail.

The Use Table shows how the supply from the last column of the Supply
Table is purchased by economic agents for various purposes at market
prices, expressed in the form of different transactions. Similar to the
production above, this table shows Intermediate Consumption, which
refers to the purchase of inputs by economic activities used to produce
the goods and services in the first table (essentially, the production
recipe for each economic activity). The portion of the supply that does
not become an input in the production process remains available on the
market for other domestic and foreign economic agents. The other
transactions in the remaining columns illustrate that these goods and
services can be exported; consumed by households, nonprofit institutions
serving households (NPISH), and the general government; or they can be
used as durable goods in gross capital formation; moved in or out of
storage to be consumed in a different accounting period (changes in
inventories); or get sold as valuable items. It is important to note
that, row by row (product detail), the Total Use column equals the last
column of the Supply Table, adhering to the economic principle of
equality between supply and demand.

In a first step, our methodology contrasts the different products from
the CPC classification against the definition of the Bioeconomy shown in
the introductory paragraphs (German Bioeconomy Council, 2018b; Gobierno
de Costa Rica, 2020b), in general, and that of biological resources in
particular, and we decide whether the product matches any of the
elements of the

\subsubsection{A deviation from other
studies}\label{a-deviation-from-other-studies}

To uncover the contribution of biological inputs to the Economy, we
propose a deviation from the existing efforts in the field; hereafter,
``the traditional approach''. These first exercises have deemed certain
economic activities as ``bioeconomic,'' based on their primary
production, and they have added together, either all, or a fraction of
their Value Added (VA) as a proxy for the ``Bioeconomic GDP''. This has
been a necessary compromise, because ``biological'' is a quality of
products, but VA and GDP are aggregates that are estimated at the
economic activity or total economy level, not from the product
perspective. While these first approximations have provided valuable
estimates of the size of the Bioeconomy, they have limitations.

Within the production account of the System of National Accounts, often
summarized into Supply and Use Tables (SUTs), economic activities can
produce more than one product and, in turn, any product in the Economy
can be produced by more than one activity. Activities will normally have
a larger fraction of their output devoted to a group of products that
share characteristics, which is deemed their primary production, and it
will be used to determine the corresponding economic activity
classification name. For example, all the production of companies that
grow strawberries, cranberries, and blackberries, almonds, cashew nuts,
and chestnuts, will be recorded under sector ``0125 - Growing of other
tree and bush fruits and nuts'' of the International Standard Industry
Classification (ISIC), Revision 4, at four digits. Some activities will
also have a smaller fraction of their production that corresponds to the
primary production of another sector. For example, it could be common in
a certain region for some berries farms to directly sell small batches
of fermented drinks that, which would normally be classified as primary
production of another activity: ``1102 - Manufacture of wines'', but
that probably do not go through a formal industrial process.
