    "This paper describes a practical methodology to estimate bioeconomy macroeconomic accounts, based on an extension of the System of National Accounts (SNA), particularly, a reordering of classifications within the Supply and Use tables of this system. In contrast to similar studies, we suggest that an *a priori* classification of economic activities as bioeconomic underestimates the real contribution of the bioeconomy. Instead we suggest limiting to classifying products as bioeconomic or not and then evaluating the bioeconomic content of intermediate consumption. We provide a detailed example of these ideas for Costa Rica and estimates for 13 Latin American economies.\n",
