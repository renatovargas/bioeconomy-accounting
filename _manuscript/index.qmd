abstract: |
  This paper describes a practical methodology to estimate 
  bioeconomy macroeconomic accounts, based on an extension 
  of the System of National Accounts (SNA), particularly,
  a reordering of classifications within the Supply and Use 
  tables of this system. In contrast to similar studies, we
  suggest that an _a priori_ classification of economic 
  activities as bioeconomic underestimates the real 
  contribution of the bioeconomy. Instead we suggest 
  limiting to classifying products as bioeconomic or not 
  and then evaluating the bioeconomic content of 
  intermediate consumption. We provide a detailed example 
  of these ideas for Costa Rica and estimates for 13 
  Latin Ammerican economies.
